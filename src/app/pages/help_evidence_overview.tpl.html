<div class="help-sub-tab">

  <p>The rows in the following table describe the minimal components of a CIViC evidence statement. Once clinical evidence statements for a variant have been curated, a summary is manually generated describing the variant's significance in cancer, along with current treatment methods. A gene level summary then synthesizes the variant summaries, and adds important gene-level information. Each variant can belong to one or more variant groups, these act to combine functionally similar or clinically related variants into a single entity.  For example, 'FGFR Fusions' is a group that contains several gene fusions where FGFR2 (or FGFR3) is involved in a fusion with various 3' partner genes, and 'Imatinib Resistance Mutations' is a group of variants that confer resistance to imatinib treatment. A variant group may also contain variants from multiple genes. For example, the group 'EGFR TKI Resistance' consists of variants in EGFR, MET, and KRAS.</p>
