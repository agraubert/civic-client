  <h4>General Guidelines</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>New Variant Names should be unique within the gene of interest. Otherwise, an Evidence Item should be assigned to the existing Variant for that gene. Before proposing a new variant, please check existing variants to prevent redundancy. For example, 'deletion' and 'loss'.</li>
    <li>The Variant Name should be the most specific possible given the literature citation (i.e., V600E over V600). In general the convention is to use the protein representation where possible (instead of the cDNA or genome representation).</li>
    <li>The Variant Name may:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>be a specific animo acid change (e.g., V600E or W288fs).</ls>
        <li>encompass more than 1 type of genomic change (e.g., Exon 12 Mutations or Frameshift Truncation).</ls>
        <li>share the same name as a variant in another gene (e.g., G12D is a Variant Name for both KRAS and NRAS).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>For fusions:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The Variant Name is always 5' partner - 3' partner.</li>
        <li>The fusion variant is entered under only one gene. Choose the 'important' gene. Often, but not always, this is the 3' gene. (e.g., the BCR-ABL Variant is associated with ABL1 Gene)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
