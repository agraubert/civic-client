  <p>Variant groups can associate multiple related variants within or between genes. Each variant can belong to one or more variant groups, these act to combine functionally similar or clinically related variants into a single entity.  For example, 'FGFR Fusions' is a group that contains several gene fusions where FGFR2 (or FGFR3) is involved in a fusion with various 3' partner genes, and 'Imatinib Resistance Mutations' is a group of variants that confer resistance to imatinib treatment. A variant group may also contain variants from multiple genes. For example, the group 'EGFR TKI Resistance' consists of variants in EGFR, MET, and KRAS.</p>
