      <h3 class="col-title">CIViC principles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We believe that the interpretations of clinical actionability required to enable precision medicine should be freely available and openly discussed across a diverse community.</li>
        <li>An interdisciplinary approach is needed to combine the expertise of genome scientists and health care providers, whose efforts are often isolated.</li>
        <li>Content should be created with transparency, kept current, be comprehensive, track provenance, and acknowledge the efforts of creators.</li>
        <li>The interface should be both structured enough to allow computational data mining and agile enough to handle the product of openly-debated, human interpretation.</li>
        <li>CIViC is committed to providing unencumbered and efficient access to community-driven curation and interpretation of cancer mutations. Curated knowledge will remain free and can be accessed anonymously without login unless the user wishes to contribute to content.</li>
        <li>To encourage both academic and commercial engagement CIViC is released with minimal restrictions under a Creative Commons license (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a>). No fees or exclusive access will be introduced. While sharing improvements is strongly encouraged, the data can be adopted and used for nearly any purpose including the creation of commercial applications derived from the knowledge. We require only that attribution be given to the community that created the content.</li>

      <h3 class="col-title">How you can contribute:</h3>
      <p>There are several ways you can make a contribution to this important problem:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Add</strong><br/>
          Propose a new genomic variant (e.g. single nucleotide substitution, structural variant, gene fusion, etc.), add evidence statements that support clinical actions associated with such variants, or help create a synthesized interpretation or summary of the corpus of evidence for a variant.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Approve</strong><br/>
          Community Editors and Moderators may approve submitted evidence items, after which the community may view and edit the item.
        </li>

        <li><strong>View</strong><br/>
          Make use of the community-created content in your own research by browsing, searching, and examining detailed evidence items. All CIViC data and source code are provided freely for almost any use.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Edit</strong><br/>
          Submit a correction or addition to any details about a genomic event, evidence statement, or interpretation.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Discuss</strong><br/>
          Participate in an ongoing discussion in an effort to reach community consensus on the appropriate clinical action(s) for a genomic event.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Apply/Reject</strong><br/>
          Editors and Moderators may apply or reject the edits made by other community members, after taking into account community discussions and opinion.
        </li>

      </ol>
