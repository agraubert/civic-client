  To create a new Variant Group use the “Add Variant Group” button below the list of Variants on any Gene/Variant page. Multiple Variants from multiple Genes may then be added by using the + button next to the Variant field. Note that a Variant must exist in CIViC in order to be added to a Variant Group. To exist, a Variant must have at least one Evidence Statement. You can add a new Variant by creating a new Evidence Item using the Add Evidence form.
