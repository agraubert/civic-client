  <h4>The Cancer Analysis Bottleneck</h4>
  <p>With the recent advent of rapid and affordable tumor genome sequencing, interpreting the clinical significance of cancer variants from the wealth of existing and rapidly evolving medical literature has become a major bottleneck to realizing the potential of precision cancer medicine.</p>
  <p>Associating cancer variants with concrete clinical actions by manual curation of high quality evidence is a great challenge. Creating useful interpretations requires integrating complex information from diverse sources ranging from preclinical lab experiments to clinical trial results. Creating and maintaining such interpretations will require the concerted effort of many experts at a large scale.</p>

  <h4>Cancer Variant Interpretation - Evidence Statements, Variant Summaries and Gene Summaries</h4>
  <p>For a primer on the fundamentals of cancer variant interpretation, we highly recommend that new users start by reading the CIViC paper and three recently published Standards and Guidelines proposals:
