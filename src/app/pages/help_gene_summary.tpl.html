  This is a user-defined description of the clinical relevance of this gene. Just as a Variant Summary should be a synthesis of Evidence Statements for a Variant, the Gene Summary should be a synthesis of the Variant Summaries for a Gene.</p> 
  <p>
  This summary should also discuss the relevance of the Gene to different cancer types, patient outcomes and treatment decisions, and highlight differences and similarities between different variants of this gene. This section may include information about the gene productâ€™s pathway interactions, functional alterations caused by variants within this gene and normal functions that are relevant to its association with cancer. Although individual evidence statements do not capture biological/mechanistic impact of variants on gene function, the Gene Summary is a place where this information may be summarized.</p>  
  <h4>Sources</h4>

  Although in-line citations are not currently supported, citations can be tracked using the Sources field and entered by specifying the PubMed ID associated with the publication. The addition of citations used to generate the gene description, particularly relevant reviews, is highly encouraged with the intention of directing other users to more in-depth information.</p>
