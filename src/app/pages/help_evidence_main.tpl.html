      <p>At the heart of CIViC is the clinical evidence statement. The clinical evidence statement is a piece of information that has been manually curated from trustable medical literature about a variant or genomic 'event' that has implications in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, or predictive response to therapy. For example, “Patients with BRAF V600 mutations respond well to the drug dabrafenib”. A variant may be a single nucleotide substitution, a small insertion or deletion, a chromosomal rearrangement, an RNA gene fusion, an RNA expression pattern (e.g. over-expression), and others. Each clinical evidence statement corresponds to a single citable publication. Ready to jump into the literature?
